Here is a **full updated README.md (in markdown)** describing every function, module, and feature of your current Roblox game and teleportation/security system:

# Roblox COP Chaser Game README

## Overview

A robust game teleportation, loadout, and security system supporting multi-place experiences, player personalization, high security, and admin debugging.

***

## Game Architecture

- **Modular design**: Each core script/module serves a clear function—easy to extend, upgrade, or swap.
- **Secure data transfer**: All important session/player data is server-generated and validated.
- **Admin tools**: Built-in GUIs and server logs for in-depth monitoring and QA.

***

## Main Components

### 1. **UnifiedTeleportHandler**
- **Purpose:** Handles outbound player teleport requests, collects player data, verifies security, packages all session/teleport data.
- **Features:** Nonce generation, loadout handling, rate limits, retries, selection of target place.

### 2. **InboundTeleportHandler**
- **Purpose:** Processes inbound joins to destination places, validates nonce, restores player state, logs all join info.
- **Features:** Teleport validation (MemoryStore), loadout restoration, anti-replay protections.

### 3. **NonceValidator**
- **Purpose:** Creates and tracks single-use nonces for all teleports.
- **Features:** Nonce saved to MemoryStore with TTL, checked on destination, deleted on join.
- **Upgrade-ready:** TTL can be adjusted; supports future analytics/logging.

### 4. **PlayerManager (PlayerDataManager)**
- **Purpose:** Loads, saves, and manages all player data during a server session.
- **Features:** Full loadout/ownership check, easily extended for cosmetics, stats, history.

### 5. **GameConfig**
- **Purpose:** All static config and data (item templates, valid admin user IDs, default loadout/data for new players).
- **Features:** Central place for editing item stats, unlock requirements, etc.

### 6. **SecurityLayers**
- **Purpose:** Core of all anti-abuse logic (rate limiting, game state checks, whitelisting).
- **Features:** Fully upgradeable for new security policies, unlocks, bans, etc.

### 7. **QueueManager**
- **Purpose:** Manages matchmaking/group queueing for team/competitive teleports.
- **Features:** Automatically groups, checks, and teleports pre-validated teams as one.

### 8. **ConfigTeleport**
- **Purpose:** Mode, place, and feature config for every teleportable area in the game.
- **Features:** Allows instant mode reconfiguration—just edit PlaceIDs and mode settings in this table.

### 9. **NetworkEvents**
- **Purpose:** RemoteEvent hub for all client-server communication (teleport requests, loadout change command, status updates).
- **Features:** Plug in new RemoteEvents here as you add features.

## Player Features

- **Secure Teleport and Session Transfer**
  - Players join/teleport with full loadout/server state.
  - Only valid, owned items can be equipped/used.
  - Nonce system blocks any exploit/replay attempts.
- **Configurable Loadout (Upgrade Plan)**
  - GUI for player to select loadout from owned list.
  - Server side validates all items before teleport.
  - Future: rate limiting, admin recovery, log events on suspicious changes.
- **Matchmaking/Queue (if enabled)**
  - Join group sessions, competitive modes, secure transfer for all team members.

***

## Admin & QA Tools

- **Data Viewer GUI:**  
  Inspect server/client/loadout data in real time.
- **Destination Server Debug Log:**  
  Prints all incoming session, loadout, nonce state.
- **Full Console Logging:**  
  Easy to trace issues, security events, and teleport outcome.

***

## Troubleshooting

- **Error 267 (security/nonce):**  
  Confirm both places are published in the same Roblox universe, and join only through lobby-driven teleport.
- **TeleportData = NO:**  
  Means destination place was launched directly, not via teleport.
- **Failed to translate string warning:**  
  Harmless Roblox message—ignore.
- **Other issues:**  
  Use detailed printouts, confirm PlaceId/GameId, nonce, and session data at each phase; reboot, republish, and always test upgrades live.

***

## Best Practices

- Only ever teleport players from the lobby/main place—never “Play” destination place directly.
- Always validate item ownership both client and server side on future upgrades.
- For complete feature/testing updates, document all new RemoteEvents and loadout validations in this README as you extend.

***

## Future/Upgrade Notes

- Add client-side loadout editor, server validation.
- Add admin in-game commands for instant loadout/debugging.
- Extend SecurityLayers for new anti-cheat logic.
- Integrate with analytics as needed for tracking teleport/nonce activity.
